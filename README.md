Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

# P0: P0 Bay Area_Bike Share Analysis

An opportunity to get started with data analysis and receive some quick feedback about your progress.

Set up iPython notebook and commonly used data analysis libraries on your own computer. Use them to dig into the results of an experiment testing the optimal length of chopsticks and present your findings.

# P1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

# P6: Create a Tableau Story

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use tableau to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualisation, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
